The models were trained for 500 epochs on around 1000 Chest X-rays and around 750 CT Scan images on Google Colab GPU. A Flask App was later developed wherein user can upload Chest X-rays or CT Scans and get the output of possibility of COVID infection.","isFork":true,"languages":[{"name":"Python","iconifyClass":"logos-python"},{"name":"HTML","iconifyClass":"logos-html-5"},{"name":"CSS","iconifyClass":"logos-css-3"},{"name":"JavaScript","iconifyClass":"logos-javascript"},{"name":"Jupyter Notebook","iconifyClass":"logos-jupyter"}]},{"id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDc0MDAxODg=","name":"DPU-MEET","createdAt":"2020-10-26T14:30:28Z","url":"https://github.com/vighneshdeepweb/DPU-MEET","description":null,"isFork":false,"languages":[{"name":"HTML","iconifyClass":"logos-html-5"},{"name":"JavaScript","iconifyClass":"logos-javascript"},{"name":"CSS","iconifyClass":"logos-css-3"}]}]}
